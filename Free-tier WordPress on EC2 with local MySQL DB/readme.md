This CloudFormation template launches a Ubuntu-based EC2 instance preconfigured to run WordPress with a local MySQL database. It automatically installs Apache, PHP, MySQL, and all required WordPress dependencies, sets up the database and user, downloads and configures WordPress, and applies proper file permissions for a working site. The stack also provisions a security group allowing HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access, creates a swap file for low-memory instances, and outputs the public URL where the WordPress site becomes accessible once deployment is complete.
