This CloudFormation template deploys a complete WordPress environment on AWS, including an Ubuntu-based EC2 web server, a private MySQL RDS database, and a simple VPC with public and private subnets. It automatically installs and configures WordPress, sets up secure security groups, provisions networking components such as an Internet Gateway and route tables, and outputs the public URL of the WordPress site and the RDS endpoint.
