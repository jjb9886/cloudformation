This CloudFormation template deploys a full WordPress environment on AWS, including an Ubuntu EC2 web server, a private MySQL RDS instance, and a simple VPC with public and private subnets. It automatically provisions networking components such as an Internet Gateway, route tables, and security groups, installs and configures WordPress on Apache/PHP, and connects it to an RDS database placed in private subnets for improved security. Once deployed, the stack outputs the public URL of the WordPress site along with the RDS endpoint.
